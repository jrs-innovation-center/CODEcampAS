# First Web Site

In this project, you will create a website that you can use to hold links to all of your other projects.

The key concepts we will be introducing in this project are:

- Creating and editing web pages
- Adding images to web pages
- Control the layout and format of a web page using CSS
- Adding JavaScript to a web page

> For the teacher, this would be a good time to create an index page to hold links
to everyones project. A index page template and instructions can be found here:
