# Animation

Making things move is a big deal for websites.

There are several ways to accomplish animation on the web:

* CSS Transitions
* CSS Animations
* JavaScript Animations

We will cover CSS transitions.
Then we will learn how to use a simple library that provides an easy way to attach animations.

## CSS Transitions

```
-webkit-transition: width 2s, height 2s, background-color 2s, -webkit-transform 2s;
transition: width 2s, height 2s, background-color 2s, transform 2s;
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/jaxigas/2/embed?html,css,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/giparor/1/embed?html,css,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

## CSS Animations

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/hizevi/1/embed?html,css,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

## Animate CSS

Animate CSS is a simple library that makes it easy to add animation to your site.

<p>
<iframe src="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" style="border 1px solid black;min-height: 300px; width: 100%;border-style: ridge;">
</iframe>


By adding this CSS to your web page, you can use the classes in the animate library to quickly animate elements on your web page.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/xorosip/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

## Exercise

Add animation to your web page: make your origin story slide in and make your super powers dance in.
Add any other animations you think would be fun.
