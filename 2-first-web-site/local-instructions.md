# Build you web site locally with your favorite editor

## Step 1

Download from Hyperdev

<a href="https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/proud-myth" target="\_new">
  Hyperdev: proud-myth
</a>

Install nodejs

[nodejs](http://nodejs.org)

Install project dependencies

> replace project name with the directory your download files are extracted to

```
cd project_name
npm install
```

then run

You should have the website running locally. Now you can deploy to the cloud using a free service called `surge.sh`,
