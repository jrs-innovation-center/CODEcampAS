# Layout

Using CSS, you can position your content to different parts of the screen.
In the following example, we are using CSS to create left and right columns.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/rinule/1/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

One of the *super powers* of HTML is how easy it is to use pieces of code from other sources and sites.
For example, you can create grids on your web page.
Using something like `Skeleton` or `Bootstrap` can save time building your own grid.

- Skeleton: http://getskeleton.com/#grid
- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/

Here's an example using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/#grid) <a class="jsbin-embed"href="https://jsbin.com/tivozu/1/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
