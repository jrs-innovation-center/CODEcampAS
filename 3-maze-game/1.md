# Gate Page

In this exercise we want to create a web page called `gate.html`

The gate page will have a message to welcome visitors to your maze and to give them options to choose from.

For example:

```
<h1>[Maze Name Here]</h1>
<p>This is the beginning of [Character's Name] fabulous maze, the goal of this maze is to find the pot of gold. You will have the option to choose some doors to go through each room, some doors may lead to more doors to pick from, some may lead to the prize, others may lead to a dead end.</p>

<p>Pick a door to start the maze.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/green.html">Green Door</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/blue.html">Blue Door</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Use the website app from the *First Web Site* project to create your maze and create the `gate.html` file. Then add your links to the gate.html, as in the example above.
