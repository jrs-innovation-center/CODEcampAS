# Maze Game

In this project, we will build a simple maze game that you can add to your website. The maze game will take players through a maze of web pages and links.

This game will teach you one of the most powerful features of the internet: The ability to link documents together using a `hyperlink`, which is very easy.


```
<a href="http://google.com">Click Here to go to Google</a>
```

This is a link. When you click anywhere on `Click Here to go to Google`, it will navigate the browser to google.com.

You can also navigate within your site as well:

```
<a href="/page2.html">Page 2</a>
```

Clicking anywhere on `Page 2` will navigate to a web page with a name of `page2.html` in the same directory as the current page.

On page 2 your can create a link back to your home page. Simply add a link element
in the body section of page2.html.

```
<body>
  <h1>Page2</h1>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
</body>
```
