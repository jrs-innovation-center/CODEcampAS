# Rooms

Now that we have the gate, we need to create two pages to represent the blue and green rooms.

Using your project, create two new pages: `blue.html` and `green.html`.
These pages should be in the same folder as your `gate.html`. Just like the gate page, you will want to provide a heading, paragraph's describing your room and some links to choose from.

For example, the blue room could have a red and yellow door links and the green room could have pink and purple links.

Then, create web pages for each of those links. Pick one to be the prize room and the rest to be dead ends.

## Extra Credit

Give the option for your visitors to go back to a previous page.
