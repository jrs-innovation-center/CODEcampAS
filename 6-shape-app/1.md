# Creating the form

## Create our file for javascript ##

Since we will be writing quite a bit of JavaScript for this project, let's store the JavaScript in a separate file.
We'll call that file  `shapes.js`.

Create the `shapes.js` file now.

Add our `shapes.js` file into the `<head>` section of the web page.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="shapes.js"></script>
```

## Create the add shape function ##

In the `shapes.js` file we will need a function that will be called whwn we want to add a shape.
We'll call this function AddShapes and it will be empty right now:

```
function AddShapes(event) {
}
```

## Start the form ##

We will create a form giving it an id so we can reference it in our JavaScript and specifying that
our `AddShapes` function get called when the *Add Shape* button is pressed.

```
<form id="theForm" onsubmit="AddShape(event)">

    <input type="submit" value="Add the Shape">
</form>
```

## Get the type of shape ##

The first question we will ask when we start to get information about a new shape is it's type.

Create a dropdown list with the values `Circle`, `Square` and `Rectangle`. Give the list an id of `shape` so we can find it using JavaScript. We will want to have the list initially show a blank choice so we'll add another option as the first choice:

```
<option selected disabled>Choose your shape</option>
```

Specifying that the option is `selected` makes it the choice that is initially displayed. Specifying `disabled` imples that it isn't really a valid selection.

## Get the radius of a circle shape ##

If the use wants to draw a circle, we next want an input field to get the radius of the circle. We will limit the radius to between 10 and 50 so the circles won't be too small or too big.

Also, we will only want to ask this question if the use is going to create a circle. To make this work we will create a division around the question using the `div` tag. We will want an id on this division so we can make it appear or disappear using JavaScript. Initially we will have the question hidden.

```
<div id="circleParms" hidden>
Radius of the circle (10-50):
<input type="text" name="radius">
</div>
```

## Get the length of a side of a square shape ##

We will do the same sort of thing for the length of the side of a square. Create a division with an id of `squareParms` and ask for the length of a side of the square. The question should be hidden as well. The input fiels should have a name of `sqSideLen`.

## Get the length of the sides of a rectangle shape ##

For the rectangle we will ask two questions; the height and width of the rectangle. Like the circle and the square we will enclose the questions in a hidden division, this time with an id of `rectangleParms`.

We will name the two questions `rectWidth` and `rectHeight`.

## Get the color of the shape ##

We will create another dropdown list for the colors. Pick a few colors from the list you can find [here](http://www.javascripter.net/faq/colornam.htm). Make sure the options values are the names from the list.

## Ask which way the shape should move ##

And finally add one last dropdown list, with the choices for movement direction. The options should have values of `u`, `d`, `l`, `r` for Up, Down, Left and Right.
