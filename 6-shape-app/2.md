# Making the Form Dynamic

We only want to ask the questions about the circle radius, square side length or rectangle heigth and width if the use want to create that type of shape.

To do this will will *dynamically* change the form depenting on which shape the use wants to create.

## Hide and Unhide the Questions ##

First we will create a JavaScript function in our `shapes.js` file. This function will, depending on the type of shape selected, hide all but the parameters for that shape. Actually, the easiest way to do this is to hide all the parameters, when just make the parameters we care about visible:

```
function SelectShape(s) {
    document.getElementById('circleParms').hidden = true

    // Set the hidden properties for the square and rectangle parms to true as well

    if (s.value == 'circle') {
        document.getElementById('circleParms').hidden = false

    // Use an else if and an else to test for and unhide the square and rectangle parms.

}

```

## Connect the Function to the Form ##

We will use this function on our form whenever the value of the select shape downdown list changes. To do this we will add a call to out SelectShape function from the onchange event:

```
<select id="shape" onchange="SelectShape(this)">

```

Now if you run the form you should be able to see the questions appear and disappear whenever you select a different value on the type of shape question!
