# Reset the Shapes to Start Over

We want to add one more button. This one will clear all the shapes so we can start over.

## Create the button ##

First add a button telling it to call the `ClearShapes` function when pushed.

## Clear the shapes ##

To actually clear the shapes we need to do three things:

1. Remove all our shapes from `two.js`.
2. Clear our list of shapes
3. Tell `two.js` to update everything.

We'll do these things in our `ClearShapes` function.

The first one is made easy because of our list of shapes. We can use the map function again to call a function we provide to remove each of the shapes. To make it easy we can include the definition of the function right in the map function call (similar to how we did the stop and start motion buttons).

```
myShapes.map( (function (s) { two.remove(s.shape); } ) );
```

For the second step in clearing the shapes we just need to reset our list of shapes:

````
myShapes = [];
```

and finally we can call `two.js` to update everything just like we did in the beginning:

```
two.update();
```
