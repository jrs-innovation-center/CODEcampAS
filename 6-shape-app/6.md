# Stop and Start the Shapes

It would be cool to be able to stop and start the shapes. It's really pretty easy to do this.

We will add a couple of new buttons. One to stop and one to start the motion of the shapes.

In the onclick event of the button we call a function we create right there to stop or start the motion.

To create a function and then immediately use it we enclose the definition of the function inside parenthesis an put there where we would usually put the name of the function. 

So instead of:

```
function_to_call()
```
we have

```
(function () { some statment; })()
```

You can see that the name of the function `function_to_call` has been replaced with `(function () { some statement;})`

So, for our button, we can tell `two.js` to stop the movement by using the following:

```
<button onclick="(function () { two.playing = false; })()">Stop Motion</button>
```

Create a second button to start the shapes moving.
