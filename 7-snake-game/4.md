# Create Snake Food

Just like the snake we want to draw the food. For this we will build a `createFood` function.

---

This function will randomly generate a location for the food using Javascript's random number generator.

```
// Generate a random position
function random(min, max) {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * (max - min)/min );
}

// Create and return the food
function createFood () {
  return {
    x: random(size, w),
    y: random(size, h)
  };
}
```

---

In the init and paint functions we want to call the create food method *before* we call `paint` for the first time:

```
function init () {
  ...
  food = createFood()
  ...
}
```

---

We'll need a function to draw the food on the canvas:

```
// This function will draw the food on the canvas
function paintFood (f) {
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fillRect(f.x * size, f.y * size, size, size);
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'white';
  ctx.strokeRect(f.x * size, f.y * size, size, size);
}
```

---

In the paint function we need to determine if the head of the snake is the same as the location of the food.
First, we get a variable with the location of the head.
If the head is on the food, then we want to randomly create another food cell.

```
var head = { x : snake[0].x,
             y : snake[0].y }

if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
  food = createFood();
}
```
