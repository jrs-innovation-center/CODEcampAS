# Controlling the Snake

In order to enable the player to control the snake, we need to capture keyboard events. We can do this by listening to the `keydown` event from the document:

```
// Call the keyEvent function passing a function that will set the direction
keyEvent(function (code) {
  if (code === 37) {
    direction = 'left'
  }
  else if (code === 38) {
    direction = 'up'
  }
  else if (code === 39) {
    direction = 'right'
  }
  else if (code === 40) {
    direction = 'down'
  }
})

// This function sets up an evet to detect the arrow keys
function keyEvent(fn) {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) { fn(e.keyCode) })
}
```

---

During the paint cycle, we need to grab the direction and repaint the screen accordingly.

First, if the snake is touching a border, end the game. By just returning from the paint
function without calling `setTimeout` the game will stop.

```
  // End of the game?
  if ( head.x === -1 ||
       head.y === -1 ||
       head.x === w/size ||
       head.y === h/size) {
    return
  }

```

---

* If the direction equals `right`? Then we increment x (column) by 1
* If the direction equals `left`? we decrement the x (column) by 1
* If the direction equals `up`? Then we decrement y (row) by 1
* If the direction equals `down`? we increment the y (row) by 1

```
  // Move the head of the snake whichever direction is selected
  if (direction === 'right') {
    head.x = head.x + 1
  }
  else if (direction === 'left') {
    head.x = head.x - 1
  }
  else if (direction === 'up') {
    head.y = head.y - 1
  }
  else if (direction === 'down') {
    head.y = head.y + 1
  }

```

---

Now, we put the new head of the snake into the array of snake segments.

What if the snake lands on the same cell as the food?

- We need to eat it.

If the snake eats the food, we need to:

* grow the snake by 1 cell
* increment food count by 1

otherwise remove tail of the snake.

```
   // Put the new head of the snake on the front of the list of segments
  snake.unshift(head)

  // If we're on the food create a new food
  if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
    food = createFood()
  }
  // If we're not on the food, just move the snake
  else {
    snake.pop()
  }
```

> Note, the first part of the if statement is already in the code.

## Extra things you can do to the game ##

* Create start and stop
* Change the color of the snake for every even cell
* Increase the size of the board
* Add a background color
