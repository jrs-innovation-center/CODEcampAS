# Create the guess function

Now that you have the web page, we need to create the guess function, this function needs to be on a script tag in the html document.

```
<script>
function guess () {
  alert('TODO: Predict the future here')
}
</script>
```

You can test this code by opening the console and running the following:

```
guess()
```

If you see an alert pop up, then you have successfully created a `guess` function.
