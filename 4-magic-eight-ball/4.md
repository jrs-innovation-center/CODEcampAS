# Create the list of answers

Now that we have our guess function and we have it hooked to the button, we simply need to add the logic. The program logic needs a list of potential answers.

You can use this list or make up your own:

* It is certain.
* It is decidedly so.
* Without a doubt.
* Yes, definitely.
* You may rely on it.
* As I see it, yes.
* Most likely.
* Outlook good.

Edit the guess function

```
function guess () {
  var answers = Array(
    'It is certain.',
    'It is decidedly so.',
    'Without a doubt.',
    'Yes, definitely.',
    'You may rely on it.',
    'As I see it, yes.',
    'Most likely.',
    'Outlook good.'
  )

  alert(answers[2])
}
```

There are two new things you may notice in this code:

The `var` and `Array`, the var means `variable` this is a language command that enables you to store values with a unique name that can be referenced later. Here we want to store a list of answers, so we give the name of the reference `answers`. The `Array` is a command that will build an unordered list or collection.
