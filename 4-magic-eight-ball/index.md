# Magic Eight Ball

The Magic Eight Ball is a toy that you can ask a yes or no question, shake it up and an answer would float through a window to give you a response. We are going to create a program that does the same thing. You can ask a question, click a button and a response will appear to tell the future.

Using this project, we will introduce you to `JavaScript`, a programming language used to make websites come alive!
