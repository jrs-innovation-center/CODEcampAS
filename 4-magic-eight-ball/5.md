# Create the Random Function

Now that we have a collection of answers, we need function that generates a random integer number between two other integers.

With this function, we want to pass it a minimum number and a maximum number, and have the function return a number within that range. In our case, we would call the function, using `0` and `7`.

Inside the body of the function we will use a built in library called `Math` this library has two functions we want to use to help us pick the right random number.

* random
* floor

The `random` method will return a random floating point number between 0 and 1.
The `floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. By doing the following equation, we will create our random integer.

```
return Math.floor(
  Math.random() * (max - min)
) + min
```

So the final result will be the following:

<div class="tonic">
<pre>
function getRandomInt (min, max) {
  return Math.floor(
    Math.random() * (max - min)
  ) + min
}

getRandomInt(0, 7)
</pre>
</div>
