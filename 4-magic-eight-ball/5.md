# Create the Random Function

Now that we have a collection of answers, we need a function that generates a random integer number between two other integers.

We want to pass two numbers to this new function that limit the range of the random integer the function will return. The first number is the minimum number returned and the second the maximum number. The function return a number within that range. In our case, we would call the function, using `0` and `7`.

Inside the body of the function, we will use a built-in library called `Math`. This library has two functions we want to use to help us pick the right random number.

* random
* floor

The `random` method will return a random floating point number between 0 and 1.
The `floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. By doing the following equation, we will create our random integer.

```
return Math.floor(
  Math.random() * (max - min)
) + min
```

So the final result will be the following:

<div class="tonic">
<pre>
function getRandomInt (min, max) {
  return Math.floor(
    Math.random() * (max - min)
  ) + min
}

getRandomInt(0, 7)
</pre>
</div>

Give it a try by pressing the `run` button.
