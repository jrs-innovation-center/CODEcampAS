# Build the Magic Form

In this exercise, use the hyperdev tool or your own text editor to create a new web page. The web page will have the following elements:

* Heading 1 - `<h1>[Title]</h1>`
* Paragraph - `<p>[Instructions here]</p>`
* Button - `<button>[command name]</button>`

Confirm with the instructor that you have your web page with at least these three elements.

If you want to validate that you have setup the form correctly on your own, you can copy the code below and paste into your web page and click the test button:

```
<script src="https://wzrd.herokuapp.com/standalone/document-has@latest"></script>
<script>documentHas(['h1', 'p', 'button'])</script>
```
