## How the internet works

The internet is a network of millions of devices and servers. Data is shared between
them using specific protocols or rules.

> A protocol is a set of rules used between devices and servers to exchange data.

## Why

The reason you want to understand how the internet works is because it is the
most common platform for providing software applications. Having a basic understanding
of what the internet is and how it works will help create software applications.

## Protocols

### TCP/IP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a low level networking protocol
that sends data from endpoint to endpoint or computer to computer in packets. These
packets are small chunks of data that are assembled together when they arrive at
the destination endpoint or computer.

IP stands for Internet Protocol. It is the low level set of rules that manage sending
data through the internet and works along side TCP to provide a robust low level
set of rules.

### HTTP

HTTP is the common protocol for the web. It is a set of rules that run on top of
TCP/IP and it enforces a very specific format of data to share between the endpoints
or computers. The initials stand for the name HyperText Transfer Protocol, it is
designed to transfer collaborative content and is the foundation of the Internet or
World Wide Web. You can read more about http here:
