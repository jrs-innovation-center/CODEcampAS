## What is a computer?

It is a machine that can perform many different purposes and can run several
applications. Programming is the practice of building recipes that can be
stored and applied to computers to modify the behavior of the machine.

For example, most machines are single purpose machines designed for one function
and one function only. A computer is designed as a multi-purpose machine.

A computer is made up of some common components that enable it to provide multiple
purposes.

- CPU - Control Process Unit - this is like the heart of the computer, it performs
all of the computation, it takes instructions and data and computes results.

- RAM - Random Access Memory is the temporary storage area of the computer, it can
hold data while the computer is powered on, when the computer is powered off, the
data in the RAM memory is gone.

- DISK - The disk is where data can persist and survive a power cycle. You can store
data on the disk in the format of files and place the files into folders.

- Display - The display is the presentation viewer for the computer, you are
most likely looking at a display right now. This is where all of the output of
an application is sent.

- Keyboard - The keyboard is used as an input device, this is the most common device
used to send input into a computer.

- Mouse or Trackpad - These are used to also send input into the computer. The
mouse or trackpad can be used to navigate between applications that are running
on the computer.

The computer can run multiple applications or programs at the same time.
