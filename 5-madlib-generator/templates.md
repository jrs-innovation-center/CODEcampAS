# JavaScript Template Literals

In JavaScript there are four ways to define a string:

```
var x = String('a string of characters')
var y = 'single quotes creates a string'
var z = "double quotes creates a string"
var zz = `back ticks create a string, the neat thing about
back tick strings is that you can create
multi-line strings and template literal`
```

In this lesson, we will learn about the `backtick string` or `template literals`.
