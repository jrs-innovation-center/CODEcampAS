# Connect the form to the template.

So, now when you press the generate story button, you are most likely getting an
error. What we need to do is collect the data from the form and assign it before
the template.

```
function generate(event) {
  event.preventDefault()
  const data = formSerialize(event.target, { hash: true})
  const template = ...
}
```

We need to include the formSerialize library by adding this script tag in
the head section of the document.

```
  ...
  <script src="https://wzrd.in/standalone/form-serialize@latest"></script>
</head>
```

So if we did everything right, we should be getting our new story, by filling
out all the fields in the form and clicking the generate story button.
