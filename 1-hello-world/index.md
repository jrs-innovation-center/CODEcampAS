# Create your first web page

What is a web page?

> A web page is a document that contains data that you want to share using a declarative
language called HTML. This language can be understood by any browser and create a consumable
presentation.

## Terms

* web - world wide web or internet. This is the largest network of computers in the world and we use it to communicate daily.
* document - is a collection of data. Tt may be text, audio, and video.
* declarative - explains what something should do instead of how it should be done.
* browser - is an application that can access web sites, pages and applications and can present them to a user.

## What is HTML?

Hypertext Markup Language is a declarative language that enables the sharing and connecting of documents and applications using the internet.

In HTML, there are several different elements that provide instruction on how to present the data embedded within the element tag.
A tag is how the elements enclose data to be presented.
For example, an element called `headings 1` uses the `h1` symbol to represent the element.
By including the element in brackets, it constructs the starting tag; by including the element symbol in brackets with a slash indicates the ending tag.

As you saw in the demo, there are a number of tags that frame the page including `html`, `head` and `body`.
These tags provide control information to your web browser, as well as setting things like the title for the page.
We will be copying those tags for now; our work will be inside the `body` tag.
```
<!-- start tag -->
<h1>
  <!-- data goes here -->
</h1>
<!-- end tag -->
```
