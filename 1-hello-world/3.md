# Lists

In all websites, you want to create lists of things.
Using HTML, we can list items in an unordered (bullet point) list or an ordered (numbered) list.

- ul - element name for an unordered list
- ol - element name for an ordered list

When you create a `ul` or `ol`, the items are actually nested inside the element tags.
Items are created with `li` elements.

```
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

In this exercise, create an unordered list of three colors.
